#Javas is a Platform

Java is not just a language it is a platform which consist of 

* Libraries 
* Reusable code
* Provided services
* Garbage collection

# What is garbage collection ?

The garbage collector is a program which runs on the Java Virtual Machine which gets rid of objects which are not being used by a Java application anymore. It is a form of automatic memory management.

# A Low End Theory `1991`

The original Java project was start in 1991 by Sun Micro Systemes enegineers Patrick Naughton and James Gosling ( Father of Java )

-

# Sun Microsystems `1991`
The wanted to develop a programming language that could be used for consumer devices like:

1. Microwaves
2. Calculators
3. Cable Boxes

These devices do not have alot of memory so the code executed had to be small and memory efficent.

-
# Project Green `1991`
The original name of this project was "Project Green"

The idea was to create a portable language that would generate intermidate code that could be run on any device via a hypothetical or **virtual machine**. Which lead to the creation of this device called the **Java Vitural Machine**.

-
# Vitrual Machine `1991`
In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.

-

#Oak its not just a Tree
The original name of the language created in **Project Green**, was supposed to be **Oak**. That turned out to be the name of another project, so it was rebranded to the name we know and love now **Java**

-
#Parents Just Don't Understand
The **Green Project** spent years trying to market **Java** as the language of choice for small devices, but they could not get any development teams inside of Sun to adopted it.

#Illmatic `1994`

In 1994 the **World Wide Web** part of the internet was expanding, which at the time consisted of simple browsers translating static hyper-text pages.

-
-

#Liquid Swords `1995`

In 1995 Patrick Naughton and Jonathane Payne created the **Hot Java Browser** to show off the capabilities of **Java 1.0** and this was shown at **Sun World 95** on May 23rd and its why **Java** is so big now
