#You down with OOP?

Object Oriented Programming is a way of abstracting computer programs to look and model like real world items or objects.

-
# Abstraction
Earlier programming languages focused on abstracting the machine. What OOP strives to do is abstract the real world into models.

It allows the programmer to represent elements in the **problem space** or **domain**.

# Abstration

OOP allows you to express a problem in terms of the problem , and not on the computer where the problem will run.

"Computer Science is not the science of computers, its the science of solving problems with the computer"
